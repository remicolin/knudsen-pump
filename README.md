# knudsen-pump
Program to determinate the optimal size of a Knudsen pump, the formulas are from Jie Chen's PhD:
'Numerical and experimental analysis of flows generated by temperature fields in rarefied gas : application to the design of Knudsen micropumps'
This is the last trace I have of the program but I had continued to work on it, I just don't have access to my space on the INSA servers.
